## Repository files

Within this repository, we distribute a whole-body PBPK model of  Amikacin, that has been previously developed using clinical studies in preterm-neonates [[1](#reference)] and evaluated for its predictive performance of GFR mediated clearance in term born children. 

The PK-Sim project file contains simulations of all published pediatric clinical studies employed for model predictions [[2-4](#reference)] in pediatrics. For details on the model development in pre-term neonates, quantitative model evaluation, sensitivity analysis and extensive documentation please refer to [[1](#reference)].
